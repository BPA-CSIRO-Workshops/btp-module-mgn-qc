This repository is a simple template for a Bioinformatics Training Platform (BTP) module.

General Design/Layout
=====================
These types of workshop modules are designed to be self contained. That is they contain all the
required information to permit trainers to reuse and repurpose them quickly and easily. They contain
the following 4 major elements:

 * **Handout** - This often includes background information, step-by-step exercises, questions and
   answers as well as bonus exercises for those who progress rapidly.
 * **Data sets** - This describes where to obtain the data sets, used in the handout exercises, and
   where on the computer system they should be located.
 * **Tools** - This describes which tools are used in the handout exercises and how to install them.
 * **Presentations** - This is where you will find presentations for introducing concepts that are
   explored in the handout exercises.

You will find instructions below on how to use this base template to build your own hands-on
workshop module in the BTP framework.

Roll Your Own Module
====================
Rolling your own module from scratch is a pretty big task and will require some knowledge of LaTeX.
If that doesn't scare you, then read on. Otherwise you might want to checkout some of the
pre-existing Bioinformatics Training Platform (BTP) modules for inspiration:
